- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @astrokenhayden 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, Python (using Raspberry Pi technology to make a little RC car), and just anything I find online that I don't know about. It's probably my worst habit. If someone tells me about something, I am looking it up and how to use it later that day.
